#colour detection using cv
We import the libraries Opencv and Numpy, then load the cap to get the frames from the webcam. After that we start a while Loop where we get the frames and we do the detection.
Inside the while loop we define the HSV ranges (low_red, high_red), we create the mask and we show only the object with the red color
Same for the other colors

Thanks!
